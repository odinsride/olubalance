# olubalance — Agent Guide

> This file is the source of truth for AI coding agents working in this repo. `AGENTS.md` is a symlink to this file, so Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and other agents all read the same content.

## Project overview

olubalance is a personal-finance app — an online checkbook register. Users manually enter transactions to keep a precise running balance per account, attach receipts, set savings goals via "stashes", track recurring bills, and categorize spending. The core domain is **accounts → transactions**, with supporting models for stashes (internal savings), bills (recurring transactions), categories (with fuzzy-match suggestions), and documents (file storage scoped to a user or account).

## Tech stack

- **Ruby** 3.4.8 / **Rails** 8.1
- **PostgreSQL** 17 (uses `db/structure.sql`, not `schema.rb`, because of `pg_trgm` and a SQL view)
- **Frontend**: Bulma 1.0, Stimulus 3, Turbo (Hotwire) 8 — bundled by **esbuild** (JS) and **Dart Sass** (CSS) via `jsbundling-rails` / `cssbundling-rails`
- **Auth**: Devise 5 (database_authenticatable, recoverable, rememberable, trackable, validatable, confirmable)
- **Storage**: ActiveStorage with `local` (dev + self-host default), `linode` (S3-compatible, prod), or `amazon` (S3) services
- **Background jobs**: Sidekiq 7 + sidekiq-cron, backed by **Redis** (`config.active_job.queue_adapter = :sidekiq`)
- **Redis**: also backs the Rails cache store and ActionCable
- **Decorators**: Draper
- **Pagination**: Pagy
- **Testing**: RSpec 8, FactoryBot, Capybara/Selenium, shoulda-matchers, SimpleCov
- **Lint/Security**: rubocop-rails-omakase, Brakeman
- **Config**: Figaro (`config/application.yml`)
- **AI**: ruby-openai (used for category suggestion / receipt OCR — called **synchronously** in-request, not queued)
- **Deploy**: Dokku via GitHub Actions (hosted), or Docker Compose for self-hosting (see `docs/SELF_HOSTING.md`)

**Background jobs exist and are required.** The app uses Sidekiq (Redis-backed) with five jobs in `app/jobs/`: `MonthlyInterestSweepJob`, `AssessInterestChargeJob`, `DataExportJob`, `DataImportJob`, `DataExportCleanupJob`. Two run on a cron schedule via sidekiq-cron (`config/schedule.yml`: monthly interest sweep, data-export cleanup); the others are enqueued via `perform_later` (e.g. from `DataTransfersController`). A running Redis instance **and** a Sidekiq worker process are needed in any environment that exercises these flows. Note: emails are sent **synchronously** (`deliver_now`), not via ActiveJob.

## Repo layout

yarn build                                  # one-shot JS build
yarn build:css                              # one-shot CSS build
bundle exec rails db:reset                  # drop + create + migrate + seed
```

There is **no `bin/rspec`** — use `bundle exec rspec`.

**JS package manager: yarn only.** This repo uses yarn (`yarn.lock` is the lockfile of record; `package.json` pins `"yarn": "1.22.x"` under `engines`). Never run `npm install` or `pnpm install` — they create `package-lock.json` / `pnpm-lock.yaml` and can mutate `yarn.lock` in incompatible ways. If yarn isn't on PATH, install it (`corepack enable && corepack prepare yarn@1.22.x --activate`) rather than reaching for npm. If you need to invoke esbuild/sass directly without `yarn` (e.g. to verify a bundle), call `node_modules/.bin/esbuild …` — that doesn't touch the lockfile.

## Workflow rules

- **Run RSpec before declaring work done.** At minimum run the affected spec files; for cross-cutting changes (models, controllers touched by many flows, schema), run the full suite. State explicitly in your summary whether you ran tests and what passed.
- **Never commit without an explicit ask.** Don't run `git commit` / `git push` unless the user has clearly asked for it in this session. A previous "go ahead and commit" doesn't authorize future commits.
- **Prefer Turbo Streams over full page reloads.** PATCH/POST/DELETE actions in this app generally respond with `.turbo_stream.erb` partials that replace specific DOM regions (see `app/views/transactions/mark_pending.turbo_stream.erb`, `mark_reviewed.turbo_stream.erb`, `edit.turbo_stream.erb`, the `categories/create.turbo_stream.erb`, and the `matching_rules/` streams). Follow this pattern when adding new mutating actions — don't `redirect_to` if a stream update is the natural fit.

## Architecture

**Authentication.** Devise. A custom `Users::SessionsController` extends `remember_me` to 2 weeks specifically for iOS Shortcut users (mobile quick-entry). Don't break this when changing session handling.

**Authorization.** *None* — there is no Pundit, CanCanCan, or ActionPolicy. **Every controller MUST scope through the current user**: `current_user.accounts`, `current_user.bills`, `current_user.documents`, etc. This is the IDOR boundary. When writing a new controller, copy the lookup pattern from `app/controllers/transactions_controller.rb` or another existing controller — never `Account.find(params[:id])` directly.

**ActiveStorage.**
- `Transaction has_many_attached :attachments` (multiple receipt files per transaction).
- `Document has_one_attached :attachment` (single file per document).
- Storage service is env-driven: `ACTIVE_STORAGE_SERVICE=local|linode|amazon|amazondev`. Defined in `config/storage.yml`.

**Decorators.** Draper. `ApplicationController` wraps current resources in decorators for mobile views; check the base controller before adding presenter logic in models.

**Mobile.** The app detects mobile devices and routes some flows (`/quick_transactions`, `/quick_receipts`, `/mobile_home`) to mobile-optimized variants. Don't assume desktop-only when changing transaction-creation paths.

**Background jobs.** Sidekiq (Redis-backed) is the ActiveJob adapter. Jobs live in `app/jobs/`; the cron schedule is `config/schedule.yml`, loaded on Sidekiq server startup via `config/initializers/sidekiq.rb`. `Sidekiq::Web` is mounted at `/sidekiq` behind the admin authenticate block in `config/routes.rb`. When adding a job, prefer `perform_later` and put long-running or external-API work (e.g. anything that would otherwise block a request) on a queue — but note current OpenAI calls are intentionally synchronous. Heavy data import/export already runs in jobs (`DataExportJob`/`DataImportJob`), which read/write ActiveStorage attachments, so they must share the same storage backend as the web process.

## Domain invariants (financial correctness)

These rules protect data integrity. Violating them produces wrong balances, which is the worst kind of bug in this app.

1. **Running balance integrity.** `TransactionBalance` is a read-only PostgreSQL VIEW defined in `db/structure.sql`. It computes `running_balance` as `SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY pending, trx_date, id)`. Never write to it. Any change to `transactions.amount`, `trx_date`, `pending`, the column ordering, or indexes used by that window must preserve the view's semantics. **If you're touching those columns, read the view definition first.**

2. **Counterpart transactions are atomic.** Account-to-account transfers create two `Transaction` rows linked via `counterpart_transaction_id` (see `app/controllers/transfers_controller.rb` and `Transaction#counterpart_transaction`). **Create, update, and destroy both sides together** — wrap multi-row changes in a transaction. Never leave a half-pair.

3. **Money math uses `BigDecimal`, never `Float`.** Money columns (`amount`, `balance`, `current_balance`, `starting_balance`, `goal`, `credit_limit`, `interest_rate`) are PG `decimal`. In Ruby, construct literals with `BigDecimal("12.34")` — not `12.34`, which is a Float and accumulates rounding error. If a method takes user input, coerce explicitly.

4. **Scope everything by `current_user`.** Repeated from above because it's both an architecture rule and a security invariant.

## Data transfer (export / import) — backward compatibility is an invariant

Users back up and restore all their data via a versioned ZIP archive: `DataExport::Builder` writes a `manifest.json` (stamped with `MANIFEST_VERSION`) plus attachment blobs; `DataImport::Restorer` wipes and rebuilds the user's data from it (both run in the `DataExportJob` / `DataImportJob` background jobs). See `docs/DATA_TRANSFER_COMPAT.md` for the full contract.

**The invariant: an export produced by an OLDER release must keep importing into a NEWER release.** This is now a critical, user-facing feature — a schema or feature change that silently breaks old imports is a data-loss bug. When you build anything that changes the shape of exported data (a new column, table, rename, or attachment/descriptor change), you MUST preserve it. The mechanics:

- **Add a column** → free, *only if* it's nullable or has a **DB-level default** (a model/AR default is not enough — the restorer uses `insert_all!`, which bypasses AR defaults; absent keys fall back to the DB default). Prefer `null: false, default: …` in the migration.
- **Add a new table / record type** → free; old manifests simply omit it.
- **Remove a column** → free; the restorer's `columns_only(model, row)` drops keys that aren't real columns.
- **Rename/split a column, add a `NOT NULL` column with no DB default, repurpose a column's meaning, or change the `attachments` / `category_ref` descriptor shape** → NOT free. Bump `MANIFEST_VERSION` in `DataExport::Builder` **and** add a matching step to `DataImport::ManifestMigrator::STEPS` that rewrites old manifests into the new shape.

**The guardrail:** `spec/services/data_import/backward_compatibility_spec.rb` imports a frozen v1 fixture (`spec/fixtures/data_transfer/v1/`) and a real export with a column stripped. If your change breaks old imports, that spec fails — fix it with a DB default or a migrator step, never by regenerating/weakening the fixture. Keep this spec green.

## View / frontend conventions

- **Forms**: `form_with` only (Rails 8 default). No `form_for`.
- **Stimulus**: 26 controllers in `app/javascript/controllers/`, registered via `index.js`. **Search for an existing controller before writing a new one** — there's likely something close (`shared`, `dropdown`, `inline_edit`, `typeahead`, `attachment_upload`, `transaction_list`, `trxform`, etc.). Use the `data-controller` / `data-action` / `data-<controller>-<value>-value` patterns already in use.
- **Partials**: resource-specific partials live under `app/views/<resource>/components/` with camelCase filenames. Truly shared partials live in `app/views/shared/`.
- **CSS**: Bulma 1.x classes only. Theme variables in `app/assets/stylesheets/_obtheme.scss`, overrides in `_bulmaoverrides.scss`. Don't introduce Tailwind, Bootstrap, or other frameworks.
- **Flash**: set the Rails flash; rendering is handled by `shared_controller.js` via `bulma-toast`. Don't roll your own.
- **Charts**: Chart.js via `reports_chart_controller.js`.

## Testing conventions

- **Factories, not fixtures.** Use FactoryBot factories in `spec/factories/`. Existing traits include `:income`, `:annual`, `:bi_weekly`, `:confirmed`, `:unconfirmed`. Add new traits rather than duplicating factories.
- **shoulda-matchers** is loaded — prefer `should validate_presence_of(:x)` over hand-rolled validation specs.
- **Devise integration helpers** are wired up — use `sign_in user` in request specs.
- **Capybara + Selenium** for system/feature specs (`spec/features/`). Browser tests are slow; only add them for genuinely user-facing flows.
- **`spec/support/request_spec_helper.rb`** has helpers for sign-in/sign-out via Warden.
- Transactional fixtures are enabled; don't disable them unless you have a specific reason.

## CI & deploy

CI is GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/test-and-deploy.yml`): on push to `develop`, it boots Postgres 17, builds assets, runs `bundle exec rails db:reset` in test, then `bundle exec rspec`. On success it pushes to a Dokku remote for staging deploy. The main test command in CI is `bundle exec rspec` — match that locally.

## Configuration

Secrets live in `config/application.yml` (Figaro), gitignored. The template `config/application.yml.sample` covers the keys you need: DB credentials (`OLUBALANCE_DATABASE_USERNAME` / `OLUBALANCE_DATABASE_PASSWORD`), S3/Linode storage keys, mailer creds, reCAPTCHA keys, OpenAI key.

## Working effectively in this repo

- **Broad codebase searches** ("where is X used?", "what controllers touch Y?", "show me all uses of `has_many_attached`") — delegate to the Explore sub-agent rather than running many sequential greps. With 13 models, 18 controllers, and 26 Stimulus controllers, cross-cutting questions are faster in parallel.
- **Schema questions**: read `db/structure.sql`, not `db/schema.rb` (which doesn't exist in this repo). The structure file is the ground truth for PG-specific features like `pg_trgm` and the `transaction_balances` view.
- **Before writing a new resource controller**, re-read `app/controllers/application_controller.rb` and a similar existing controller (e.g. `TransactionsController`, `BillsController`) so the new code matches the `current_user`-scoping, Turbo-stream, and decorator patterns already in use.
- **Before adding a new JS dependency**, check whether an existing Stimulus controller or Bulma component already covers the need.

## External docs (Context7 MCP)

When writing or explaining code that touches an external library API — Rails 8.1, Hotwire (Turbo / Stimulus 3), Devise 5, Pagy, Draper, RSpec 8, FactoryBot, shoulda-matchers, Capybara, ruby-openai, or Bulma 1.0 — call the Context7 MCP before answering from memory:

1. `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` with the library name.
2. `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` with the resolved ID and a focused topic.
3. Ground the answer in what comes back; don't synthesize from training-data recall when the docs are one tool call away.

**Skip Context7 for**: questions answerable from this repo's own code, trivial syntax, anything already covered by CLAUDE.md, and standard-library Ruby. Don't burn a tool call when the answer is local.

## Database introspection (Postgres MCP)

The Postgres MCP is wired to `olubalance_development` (read-only). Prefer it over shelling out to `psql` for:

- Schema questions that go beyond what `db/structure.sql` makes obvious (live indexes, row counts, statistics).
- Sanity-checking a migration's effect — query the table after running it.
- Verifying that a query plan for a transaction-listing query actually uses the indexes backing the `transaction_balances` window.

For schema-of-record questions, `db/structure.sql` is still authoritative — the MCP is for the live state.
